## Hard 01: Building packages for inexperienced R users

Building packages for inexperienced R users mainly depends on the
experience the user has. 
if he has used R before then itâ€™s mainly about having a proper documentation.
In that case following the proper practices of building packages would help a lot. 

* The vignettes should thoroughly cover all the functions and data. 
* It should be well documented with sample usage codes. 
* Fitting and simple names should be given to functions. 
* Parameters could be less in number with defining default values as much as possible. 

If the user has never used R before, then it makes sense to abstract all the 
implementation and give user only what he wants to see. in that case a GUI 
application doing what he wants to do would be handy.

* Desktop Applications can be made with `gWidgets` and 
* web applications can be made with `shiny`.


## Hard 02: Managing DwC data in R

The DwC data is a massive volume of data of organisms mainly categorized 
into 7 main subsets and two more complex subsets. The data can be retrieved 
from `GBIF` but the problem lies in the volume of data. As of today, there are 
`716428135` occurrence records and each record has around 111 fields. In order to store 
the data in R and manage or process we need to think of few feasible methods. 

First of the DwC covers all aspects of the organism to suit the needs of all researchers. 
But most of the time for any specific need the number of fields required will be very
less than that in the original data. So only the fields required for the task should
be loaded onto the R. This would increase the performance. 

And while reading in the data, first a small subset of data should be loaded and classes
of each fields should be identified. Then, after assigning the classes of data to
read function, the retrieval can be done faster. 

Another way of managing DwC data efficiently is to manage it through databases. The data 
can be stored in databases and by indexing the values, the data can be aggregated and 
retrieved as per need or request in real time much faster. This would definitely increase 
the efficiency. If the Data is Huge it makes sense to use concepts like `Hadoop` too.

If we take the DwC concept into account, few things should be taken in acoount

* the standard promises it will have growth (new terms, additional meanings). So the 
    data we store in R or manage should also be possible to be expanded and merged with new datasets.
* Data quality and fitness for use are primary concerns in the biodiversity community. So 
    the data in R should undergo an extended pipeline of data cleaning and standardization to 
    make sure the data can be used effectively and for longer periods.
